As there is no bounding fence, wildlife is free to roam to and from the property. The biggest concern is that there may be hibernating snakes under rocks or stones. Snakes will flee from the area if there is a good amount of human activity. As this is Florida, other insects and organisms will be present on the property including ticks, mosquitoes, wasps, and spiders. Closed toe shoes is mandatory. Long socks, long pants, breathable long sleeve shirt, and work gloves will reduce the chance of bites and stings from these organisms. Eye protection can be available for working in wooded areas to avoid pokes from eye-level branches. I can provide bottles of water and packaged snacks for volunteers.",
